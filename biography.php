        <p>
            Hey, like you can see I’m not the typical type of guy you see with a camera!
            I love to travel in America, especially in the South. Born and raised by all my brothers and sisters, a
            tourist left his camera near our stash. Since that day I developed
            a real passion for photography and now I want to share it with people !
        </p>
        <h2 class="skills">Passionate</h2>
        <p>
            love to travel and discover new places, meet new people, habitat and cities. That was my dream when I
            was younger and now it became reality. It’s a pleasure to have
            this opportunity and to share it with you. Have fun browsing my site, made with all my little heart !
        </p>
        <h2 class="skills">Professional</h2>
        <p>
            Special thanks to Lola, Emilie, Sten, Aurelien, Aristide Taegyung and Loukman !
